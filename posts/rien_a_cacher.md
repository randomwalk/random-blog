It's always dangerous to equate "privacy" with "hiding." It isn't about hiding, it's about controlling whether or not you can hide. In bigger words, "informational self-determination." Privacy is the right to control information about yourself.

If you make the choice that you are okay with the world seeing your pictures, your location, your health information, and so on, that's totally fine. That's still privacy. That's still you exerting control over your information. If someone else makes the choice to let the world see your pictures, your location, or your health information, without your consent, that's not fine. That's a violation of your privacy. That's you losing control over your information.

Your friend makes choices over who can see his information, and in doing so, he is exerting his control over it. His choices — a broad allowance — are not your choices, and you would not want him choosing for you, just as he would not want you choosing for him. You are both making valid privacy decisions.

However, you could suggest to him that he should respect other people's right to exert more control over their information than he does, just as you would.

If you think privacy is unimportant for you because you have nothing to hide, you might as well say free speech is unimportant for you because you have nothing useful to say. -- Snowden

They agree that solitude and privacy is a nice thing to have, but that on balance they prefer to feel secure even if it means sacrificing some privacy - and since they make a large portion of the population they feel as though it's in line with democracy.

To convince someone that they're wrong you need to argue on terms that they agree with otherwise they'll simply dismiss you.
