It's always dangerous to equate "privacy" with "hiding." It isn't about hiding, it's about controlling whether or not you can hide. In bigger words, "informational self-determination." Privacy is the right to control information about yourself.

If you make the choice that you are okay with the world seeing your pictures, your location, your health information, and so on, that's totally fine. That's still privacy. That's still you exerting control over your information. If someone else makes the choice to let the world see your pictures, your location, or your health information, without your consent, that's not fine. That's a violation of your privacy. That's you losing control over your information.

Your friend makes choices over who can see his information, and in doing so, he is exerting his control over it. His choices — a broad allowance — are not your choices, and you would not want him choosing for you, just as he would not want you choosing for him. You are both making valid privacy decisions.

However, you could suggest to him that he should respect other people's right to exert more control over their information than he does, just as you would.

If you think privacy is unimportant for you because you have nothing to hide, you might as well say free speech is unimportant for you because you have nothing useful to say. -- Snowden

They agree that solitude and privacy is a nice thing to have, but that on balance they prefer to feel secure even if it means sacrificing some privacy - and since they make a large portion of the population they feel as though it's in line with democracy.


    Ultimately, saying that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different from saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say. Or that you don't care about freedom of the press because you don't like to read. Or that you don't care about freedom of religion because you don't believe in God. Or that you don't care about the freedom to peacably assemble because you're a lazy, antisocial agoraphobe.
    Edward Snowden in Permanent Record

    The NSA has built an infrastructure that allows it to intercept almost everything. With this capability, the vast majority of human communications are automatically ingested without targeting. If I wanted to see your emails or your wife's phone, all I have to do is use intercepts. I can get your emails, passwords, phone records, credit cards. I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of things... I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded. That is not something I am willing to support or live under.
    Edward Snowden in The Guardian

    We all need places where we can go to explore without the judgmental eyes of other people being cast upon us, only in a realm where we're not being watched can we really test the limits of who we want to be. It's really in the private realm where dissent, creativity and personal exploration lie.
